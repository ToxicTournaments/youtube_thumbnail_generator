# youtube_thumbnail_generator
A python script for generating YouTube thumbnails of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate tournament games. The script will analyze the videos in a directory and scan them for the player's names and player's characters.

* Must have original video files if you use a stream recording that transitions away from the character selection screen it will not be able to scan the video files for the characters and players. 

Point to your video file location and it will scan the videos to generate the thumbnails.
